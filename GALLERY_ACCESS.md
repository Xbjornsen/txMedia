## ❌ **What Was Missing**

You couldn't click on anything because:

1. **No navigation link** to access client galleries
2. **No test galleries** created yet  
3. **Environment variables** not set up
4. **Database** not initialized

## ✅ **What's Now Added**

### 🧭 **Navigation Links**
- Added **"Client Gallery"** button to main navigation (desktop + mobile)
- Links directly to `/gallery/login`
- Styled with accent border to stand out

### 📋 **Setup Instructions**

   ```

3. **Create test gallery:**

   ```

4. **Test the flow:**
